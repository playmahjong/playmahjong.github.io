    <h2>
      In this guide I will teach you how to win the game of Mahjong 
    </h2>
   
    <p>Before beginning to learn about setting up, it’s important to note now that when playing mahjong it can only be played with only 4 players, and sometimes with 3 players which requires a few changes
    </p>
    <p><span>Each of the 4 seats are labelled with one of the winds, which are east, south, west and North. Also there are 4 rounds played in mahjong and each round is also labelled with a wind name, in that same order.

        </span></p>
        <p><span> is important as point calculation for the winner is dependant on their seat wind and some winning methods also take your seat wind or round wind into account, this will all make sense once you finish this guide.</span></p>
        
        <img class="img1" src="img11.png" alt="">
        <p>There are two tables below, the first shows the methods of winning with closed play only. And the second table is for both hidden and open plays</p>
<p>We recommend you start off by learning the most common easy methods of winning, which we will colour in white for you, so you don’t get too overwhelmed and can begin playing. Then you can slowly keep learning more and put them into practice
</p>
<p><span>P.S - The good thing about keeping your play hidden/closed without stealing, is that if you cant complete any of the methods of winning below, then you can go for 2 winning methods that don't have any requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>The first one is called Riichi which only requires you to place an extra 1000 point bet when waiting for your last winning piece. The second one is called Tsumo which is to win by drawing your winning piece instead of stealing it
</span></p>
<p><span>Now take a look at both tables below and we recommend beginning with the green coloured ones as they are the most common ones
</span></p>
