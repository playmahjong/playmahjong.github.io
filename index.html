      <h2>In this guide I will teach you how to play the game of Mahjong</h2>
      <img class="img1" src="img1.png" alt="" />
      
      <p>
        I have split this guide into 3 sections. First is this intro, which will
        discuss how the game works and the rules simply. Then move onto the
        second and third sections will allow you to put this knowledge into
        practice, to actually play a game with friends and family
      </p>
      <p>
        The game of mahjong uses tiles for playing and are used similarly to
        playing cards, as in there are numbered suits. There are 3 different
        suits that are numbered from 1 to 9 and 2 extra suits which we will
        explain shortly
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img2.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        There are 4 identical copies of each tile so there are 136 tiles in
        total
      </p>
      <p>
        There is the circles suit numbered 1 to 9. And there are 4 copies of
        each number so Thats 36 circle tiles in total
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img3.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        There is the characters suit numbered 1 to 9. And there are 4 copies of
        each number so thats 36 character tiles in total
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img4.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        And the bamboo suit numbered 1 to 9. And there are 4 copies of each
        number so thats 36 bamboo tiles in total
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img5.png" alt="" />
      <p>That’s 108 total numbered suits</p>
      <p>Now lets talk about the 2 extra suits, which are called honor tiles</p>
      <p>
        First is the dragon suit which has 3 different dragons with 4 copies
        each, which is a total of 12 dragon tiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is the red Dragon, Green Dragon and the White or square dragon
      </p>
      <img class="img6" src="img22.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The second suit from the honor tiles is the winds, which are simply
        east, south, west and north, with 4 copies of each one which is a total
        of 16 wind tiles
      </p>
      <img class="img6" src="img11.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        That’s a total of 28 honor tiles plus the 108 numbered tiles which is a
        total of 136 tiles as mentioned before
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >It's important to note that the game originally comes with 144 tiles
          with another extra suit called the flower suits, however in most
          places the game is played without these flower tiles and only the
          tiles we already mentioned</span
        >
      </p>

        whenever you need a reminder throughout this guide
      </p>
      <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
      <p>
        To play Mahjong you must set up some walls for each player to draw
        from when it’s their turn and each player must start with 13 tiles. You
        can learn how to set up this wall and other technical things for playing
        at the end of the guide in the setting up section.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play, each player will draw a tile from the wall then discard one
        face up for everyone to see, going anti-clockwise
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img8.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The aim of the game is to create combinations and the first to combine
        all of his tiles wins
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img1.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        However you must complete two conditions in order to win, the first
        is to have 4 combinations of 3 pieces each, and a pair (14 total pieces)
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >Combinations are of 2 types - three identical pieces also known as
          a triplet, or a sequence of 3 numbers like 3,4,5 and of course one
          pair of 2 identical tiles to win the game</span
        >
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img9.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The second condition is to complete a method of winning. Methods of
        winning are simply criterias for your combinations for example one
        method of winning is called a flush which requires all your combinations
        including the pair to be of the same suit. All methods of winning are
        listed in a table in the how to win section.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the game of Mahjong there is a feature where you can steal pieces
        discarded by other players to complete your combinations
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >If stealing to complete a sequence this is called “Chi” and can
          only be stolen from the player before you</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >If stealing to complete a triplet this is called "Pon" and can be
          stolen anytime a piece is discarded then it becomes your turn
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >If stealing to complete 4 identical tiles, this is called "Kan"
          this can also be done anytime, and this “kan” combination will just
          count as a triplet, therefore you must draw an extra piece to balance
          out your pieces (in order to complete the first condition of winning -
          4 combos of 3 and a pair)</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          >If more than one person want to steal, there is an order of
          precedence, with “pon/kan” having presence over “chi”. And of course
          winning from a discarded tile takes the highest precedence</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        If you steal a piece, you must put this newly formed combination to
        your right side for all players to see, and now you hand is called an
        open hand (which comes with some disadvantages)
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="img10.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        <span
          >The disadvantage is that some methods of winning can only be done
          when your play is closed, however most winning methods can be done
          with both open and closed hands. However stealing a winning piece
          doesnt make your hand open
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>Each method of winning will give the player a certain number of 'han'.</p>
<p>These "Han" will be converted into points at the end and each player starts with 25,000 points. How to calculate these points will be covered in the calculating points section.
</p>
<p>Now move onto the how to win section to learn some of the winning methods when creating your combinations.</p>
